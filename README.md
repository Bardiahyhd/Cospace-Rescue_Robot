Codes from 2019 - 2021 for the Cospace Rescue Robot challenge.

There are Code Backups from 2019 to 2021 in C language saved in texts that you can use. (Its in Solar Hijri months)
the most advanced ones (back up) use Dijkstra algorithm and some geometry calculation. 
also there are some cool helpers for scanning the map, getting points, path direction and stuff like that. (Bardia Razavi/python)
there are also alot of line of code for no reason or commented, ignore them.
and you might find some random games in them.
  
Feel free to use anything if u need any
enjoy!
